<P> I am modidifying the the first line of my code, now with master instead of edits. A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches and becasue it doesn't ley you switch between branches it is stringly integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands.<P>
